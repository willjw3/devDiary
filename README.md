  Developer Log
</h2>

This is my developer blog. It was built with an official Gatsby starter that I created. You can find that starter in the Gatsby Starter Library. (See below)<br>

*Developer Diary is a Gatsby Starter blog template created with web developers in mind, but really, anyone can use it. It's totally usable right out of the box, but minimalist enough to be easily modifiable to suit your needs. No matter how much you change it, though, you'll definitely want to make use of the tech tags and developer social media links, and maybe even make some of your own.*<br>
