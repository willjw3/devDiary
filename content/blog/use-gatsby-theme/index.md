Recently, I made a Gatsby theme to see what all the fuss was about. I have to admit, things seemed easier when I first worked out how to build a site off a starter from the Gatsby library. The big advantage to using Gatsby themes in your site is that you can use multiple themes and they can be updated after upstream changes have been made.
